## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
  
### Continued development

One thing I want to really focus on in future projects is how to make my designs more responsive. That is, to make the process a lot more easier using vanilla CSS and HTML. The goal for me is to become proficient in vanilla HTML and CSS before moving on to a framework. So that is something that I want to continue to develop.
